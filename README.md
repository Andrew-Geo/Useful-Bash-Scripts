# Useful-Bash-Scripts
A variety of miscellaneous bash scripts I've written, for a variety of uses.  
Sometimes oddly specific, sometimes generic enough to be useful.  
Sometimes may be good, sometimes may be sh*t.

## Structure:  
Scripts are to be found within their own subdirectories, along with instructions when needed,  
under a broader category/directory (e.g. Desktop, Server).

## Notes:  
Most scripts may use features and syntax of programs that fall withing GNU extensions.  
These scripts may not work with *BSD systems and may not be POSIX compliant.

## Additionally:  
Scripts may and may not be updated and added.
